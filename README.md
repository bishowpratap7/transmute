# Transmute

This is an open source project designed to help community with 100% free conversions of any documents such as DOCX to
PDF, TXT to PDF, PDF to IMAGE and more to come as we build this project. We will work on making sure that this project
will be suitable for both personal and enterprise use for free.

With Transmute we can:

1. Convert Word Docx to PDF. (Currently focused on this one only)
2. Convert all foreign languages (non english) characters inside word document to PDF.
3. Handle Macros inside the word document as is to PDF.
4. Handle Content Control Boxes and texts inside the word document.

Current Challenges:

1. Docx4j, Apache POI and other libraries can convert simple DOCX to PDF but not some of the scenarios below.
   a. Not all foreign languages are converted correctly.
   b. Can't handle Macros and texts inside content control boxes.

Asking for Help:
To resolve these challenges we will need your help. Please feel free to be a contributor for this project.
